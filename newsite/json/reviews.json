Immediately. I am a stickler when it comes to customer service. Especially in this day & age where it seems like corporations seem to hire the most incompetent employees known to man. But not OPUS!!! Angela made sure I could retrieve my package, and even stayed on the phone to serve as my personal navigation system to the property. Opus should be changed to Angela’s because she runs this place like it’s her name on the business! Passionate. Committed. & Customer Service Centric in spirit. I am so grateful for her professionalism & genuineness to help me!",

Within a commendably brief span of less than 48 hours post my purchase, I was delighted to receive an email from Ms. Vargas. The content of her correspondence not only conveyed important details but was framed in such a manner that made me genuinely feel welcomed and valued as a member of the Opus VO community. Furthermore, Ms. Vargas diligently ensured open lines of communication, extending her contact details and personally reaching out via phone a few days later for an introduction. Such gestures, though seemingly simple, are reflective of her proactive commitment to fostering client relationships. Drawing from her extensive experience, notably from her tenure at Regus, Ms. Vargas possesses an in-depth understanding of the industry. It was evident in our conversations that she is a passionate advocate for Opus VO. As someone who has previously engaged with Regus, I confided in Ms. Vargas my intent to redirect associates, friends, and family towards Opus VO, largely attributable to the value proposition Opus VO offers in comparison to competitors. As the founder and CEO of Lamb IT Solutions, LLC, I have had myriad interactions with professionals from various sectors. I can assertively state that Ms. Vargas exemplifies the very essence of professionalism, subject matter expertise, and genuine client engagement. In conclusion, Ms. Lesli Vargas is undoubtedly an asset to Opus VO, reinforcing the brand's commitment to excellence. I am certain her contributions will continue to enhance your brand's reputation. It's a privilege to have professionals like her as the face of your organization. Warm regards, James Lamb, Jr. Founder & CEO Lamb IT Solutions, LLC.",

My mail is secure, incoming calls are handled professionally, the receptionist is very congenial, and the conference rooms are kept clean. I plan ahead as best as possible, and therefore have no conference room scheduling issues.",

Their monthly fee is very reasonable versus what you get in terms of services and a good address for your company or organization. Our company has been using them for over 2 years and we have no intentions of changing. BTW, virtual doesn't mean no people to help you, the staff at our location has always been great and ready to help us whenever we needed assistance. Great service and easy to business with. Highly recommended.",
