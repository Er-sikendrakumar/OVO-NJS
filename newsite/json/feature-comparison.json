Opus is the only provider that includes unlimited toll-free calls when you purchase a Toll-Free number from them for only $10/mo. Texting is the same, as only Opus includes unlimited texting when you add this upgraded feature for only $10/mo. None of the other virtual office providers even offer texting as a feature. Perhaps my favorite upgraded feature which is also only available from Opus is their Callout feature, which enables you to display your business phone number on all outbound calls for only $10/mo utilizing their proprietary app!"

While Regus actually advertises pricing based upon a 2-year contract, you can go month-to-month with Regus, albeit at a much higher price point. For purposes of my analysis, I used their 6-month contract pricing in order to provide a more realistic comparison, as they do not have a 3-month option."

Specifically, Opus is typically the best choice throughout the USA and in some parts of Canada and Puerto Rico; however, if you are looking for an office outside of these areas, then Regus, Davinci, or to a lesser extent, Alliance, may be your only alternatives. It is for that reason that Regus is often the preferred choice for Fortune 500 corporations with big budgets, as they prefer to deal with one vendor that can accommodate their employees worldwide. Another situation where Regus could be the best choice is if you intend to spend a lot of time working out of your virtual office. While all 4 virtual office providers have meeting rooms which you can rent out by the hour, not every location offers an office or cubicle that you can rent out by the day. If you require regular co-working space, then I suggest that you compare individual locations from each provider in order to find a location that best meets your specific needs."
